## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
- Git
- A Discord application with bot token
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Discord.js

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/discord-music-bot.git
   cd discord-music-bot/Music_Bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Discord bot token and settings
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Uses nodemon for auto-restart
   ```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Use ESLint**: Follow the existing code style
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Files: `camelCase.js`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

- **Structure**:
  ```
  Music_Bot/
  ├── commands/          # Discord commands
  ├── utils/             # Utility functions
  ├── config.js          # Configuration
  └── index.js           # Main bot file
  ```

### Command Development

#### Creating a New Command
```javascript
// commands/example.js
const { EmbedBuilder } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
    name: 'example',
    aliases: ['ex', 'demo'],
    description: 'An example command',
    usage: 'example <argument>',
    async execute(message, args, client) {
        // Command logic here
        const embed = new EmbedBuilder()
            .setColor('#0099FF')
            .setDescription('Example command executed!');
        
        message.reply({ embeds: [embed] });
    }
};
```

#### Command Requirements
- **Error Handling**: Always wrap in try-catch blocks
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear success/error messages
- **Permission Checks**: Validate user permissions
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all inputs
- **Rich Embeds**: Use Discord embeds for better UX

### Testing Guidelines

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Command responds correctly to valid inputs
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid inputs
- [ ] Permissions are properly checked
- [ ] No memory leaks or hanging processes
- [ ] Works across different Discord servers
- [ ] Embeds display correctly on mobile and desktop

#### Automated Testing (Future)
We plan to implement automated testing. For now, please thoroughly test manually.
